This is our project about an analysis on the housing market and by calculating the increase in house prices by the increase in income we can see how big the problem really is 
and if there is even a problem. For our analysis you only have to source Masterfile.R because in that file it sources every other code we have written for the project and that is the only way to generate all the graphs and maps and let it grab the right information. This is because all the packages used in the other codes like Spatial.R are all in the Masterfile.R code file.

All of our data was collected from CBS and the way you download this dataset and execute the code correctly is first download this as a zip. if you are in Rstudio open the Masterfile.R and before you source the Masterfile.R code you set the working directory in the folder you downloaded. If it is correct you can succesfully load all the code and look at all the plots if you install all the necessary packages. We hope you can get something useful out of our analysis.
